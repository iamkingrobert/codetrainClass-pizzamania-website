                <h3>Pizza Hut Is Yummy</h3>
                <p>In terms of the environment, Pizza Hut has the best look & feel
                     that I've seen in take away places. Neat and clean table, decorated
                      with plants and edgy walls. The service was helpful and friendly, 
                      and the pizzas were good. Their pizzas are smaller than other places;
                       the large is the size of a medium and a small is barely enough 
                       for a little kid, but that aside, it was good.</p>
